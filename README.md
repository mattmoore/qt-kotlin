# Qt Kotlin

This is a project to build a wrapper library around Qt for Kotlin. Eventually, this should be cross-platform compatible. However, I am starting with Kotlin Native, as there are no good GUI options for Kotlin Native.

## Qt Version

Currently, I am targeting Qt 5.

## Project State

I am just starting this out. Theres' a long road ahead.
